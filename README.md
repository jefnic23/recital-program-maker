# Recital Program Maker
Create neatly formatted recital programs quickly and easily

**Supported browsers**: Chrome, Firefox

**Note**: there is an issue with the way the program looks on smaller devices. This is being worked on, but programs will still print properly formatted (you can use "Preview" to confirm this).

## New features:
- Hover over program entries for options to move, edit, and delete
- Toggle "Place performer(s) on top" to swap the positions of performers and pieces

## How-To
Upload a spreadsheet:
- grab the template from [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CK7CRbGqo_S3vZ2KLCFBSKyBFl5XKLUXu73X-q1-2aI/edit#gid=0)
- there is an example tab at the bottom showing how to fill out the template
- copy the template to your Google drive, or download a copy to your device
- make sure to download it as a .csv file
- when you're ready, save the completed template and click the upload button on the site
- when you load the file, the program will fill automatically

## Note
When using the preview option, the image is slightly distorted. For a clearer image of what the final product will look like, click the print button instead. It will open a new tab where you can view the program as it will look when printed.
